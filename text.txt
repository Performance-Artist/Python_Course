Python in the Real World
So, is learning Python worth the time and effort? Is it a fad or a toy? Actually, it’s been
around since 1991 (longer than Java), and is consistently in the top 10 most popular
computing languages. People are paid to write Python programs—serious stuff that you
use every day, such as Google, YouTube, Dropbox, Netflix, and Hulu. I’ve used it for
production applications as varied as an email search appliance and an ecommerce web‐
site. Python has a reputation for productivity that appeals to fast-moving organizations.
You’ll find Python in many computing environments, including the following:
• The command line in a monitor or terminal window

• The Web, on the client and server sides
• Backend servers supporting large popular sites
• The cloud (servers managed by third parties)
• Mobile devices
• Embedded devices
Python programs range from one-off scripts—such as those you’ve seen so far in this
chapter—to million-line systems. We’ll look at its uses in websites, system administra‐
tion, and data manipulation. We’ll also look at specific uses of Python in the arts, science,
and business.
